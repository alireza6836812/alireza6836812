If you want to get to know me, you’re in the right place
### Who am I?

I’m generally a physics student and a computational physics enthusiast, but I don’t limit myself to just one field. I’m fascinated by psychology, philosophy, musicology, and pretty much anything I can learn. As a programmer, my main focus is data science. As a curious persin, I love figuring out how things work, and what better way to explore the world than through data?

### What am I currently working on?

Right now I work as a Product Development Specialist at Mohaymen ICT Group. We focus on turning data into useful products, using automated tools, databases, and metadata management — all connected with big data. On the personal side, I’m working on projects to automate parts of my life and make it a little easier, because, well… as he said: linving hurts.

### What tools do I use?

I like to keep my options open, but Python and SQL are the tools I’m playing with most these days. I also have experience with Kotlin and I’m excited to learn Rust and R. My other tools are my cup, laptop, phone (I often use Termux, it feels like I'm a cool hacker).
